Our first full stack app of the class.

inCrypt is a crytocurrency portfolio that that can keep track of trade history, values, and total portfolio value by storing them in MySQL.  This will also track changes over time. Version 1.0 tracks 24 hour changes and 30 days changes.

Calls to a cryptocurrency API were made to get time based values of the coins. Client-side calculations were made to determine the value.
